# K Means Clustering
A python implementation of a basic k-means clustering algorithm
## Basic Idea
1. Initialize k random centroids based on random datapoints
2. Assign each datapoint to a cluster based on the nearest centroid
3. Choose the center point of each cluster as the new centroid for that cluster
4. Repeat until convergence
## Dependencies
Python 3.6  
Matplotlib  
Pandas  
Dataset - 2013 NBA Point Guard Stats (via DataQuest)
